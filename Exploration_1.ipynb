        "## Introduction - A Brief History\n",
        "The Collatz conjecture, an idea brought up in 1937 by German mathematician Lothar Collatz, is said to be a problem that current day mathematics is not yet ready to solve. Mathematicians throughout history have lamented over spending months of research on it only to arrive at nothing. It was even joked to be a conspiracy meant to slow down mathematical research in the U.S. In the simplest terms, the conjecture looks at a sequence of integers where the next integer is determined from the previous term following two rules\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   If the integer is even, divide by 2\n",
        "2.   If the integer is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1\n",
        "\n",
        "It is conjectured that for any positive integer first inputed, the sequence will eventually arrive to the value 1 and from there be stuck in a constant loop (going: 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, ...). The only ways to deviate from this loop would be to either find another loop that forever repeats or find an integer that increases forever. To this day, no sequence of those types has been found.\n",
        "\n",
        "Click [here](https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2019/12/CollatzGraph_1300Lede.mp4) to see a visual on how this beautiful menace of a conjecture behaves.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project we will explore these rules as well as additional properties of the Collatz Conjecture. We will see what happens when allowing for negative number, how \"changing the rules\" can affect the outputs, and look at the behavior of dropping time. \n"

Third, we change the rule to multiply even numbers by 2 and divide by 3. Fourth, multiply even numbers by -1 and divide by 2. Lastly, we change the rule to multiply odd numbers by 4 and subtract 2 followed by multiply odd numbers by 2 and add 5."

        "After experimenting with the Collatz Conjecture by changing the rules, looking at how it acts with negative integers and analyzing the drop times, we found many interesting things. When we were changing the rules of the conjecture we observed that when changing the rules for when n is even, the series still ended up with a 4,2,1 loop. However when we changed the rules when n was odd, the series took on a whole new identity. When inputing negative numbers into the conjecture it created a loop of -20,-10,-5,-14,-7,-10,-5,-14,-7. Lastly, for the drop time we observed that there are repeating drop times patterns where it follows: 1,3,1,a, 1,3,1,b, 1,3,1,c, 1,3,... while a, b, c...are a random number.\n"

        "Although the Collatz Conjecture is nowhere near proved, UCLA mathematician Terence Tao received the Fields Medal in 2006 for making the most progress on this proof. The Fields Medal is the highest honor, and he is regarded as one of the top mathematicians of his generation. Funnily enough, what gave him this genius idea was an anonymous comment on his blog that stated as long as he could prove it worked for *almost* all numbers, not all, it would be sufficient. That idea lead Tao to realize he could apply techniques used to study partial differential equations to the Collatz Conjecture. The technique: using large samples of numbers and applying the conjecture. If almost 100% of the sample behaved the same way (going to 1), then it would be enough to conclude that it worked for the whole sample. However, each sample had to be weighted the same - and by weights, that means that the numbers in the sample share a property. Tao's first sample excluded multiples of 3 because the conjecture quickly went through multiples of 3. He then moved on to include samples 3 modulo 1 and then 3 modulo 2. The goal of using weighted samples was to ensure that most of the numbers maintained the same character as they were cycled through the conjecture. With this technique he was able to prove that 99% of all starting values greater than 4 quardrillion end up in a number smaller than 200. Although this conclusion is still a speck in the exploration of the Collatz Conjecture, is the closest conclusion reached in history."
